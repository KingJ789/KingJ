<!-- Some of the CSS display values which are commonly used.
1. display: inline;
inline element takes the required width only. It doesn't force the line 
break so the flow of text doesn't break in inline example.

2. display: inline-block;
CSS display inline-block element is very similar to inline element but 
the difference is that you are able to set the width and height

3. display: block;
CSS display block element takes as much as horizontal space as they
can. Means the block element takes the full available width. They 
make a line break before and after them.

4. display: none;
The "none" value totally removes the element from the page. It will 
not take any space. -->
