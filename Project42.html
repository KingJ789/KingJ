                <center> <p class = "Poopoo">In cricket, we hit hard balls with our bat and if it goes very far its 6 . if its mid far its 4 . if its barely went its a 2 or 1. Also if somewone catches it your automatticaly out and if it hits the stumps you are also out, very fun sport but if the balls hit your face your done for. </center>
