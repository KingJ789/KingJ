 Jaggi Vasudev is known worldwide as Sadhguru. He was born on 5 September 1957 in Mysore in Karnataka.
<br><br>
 Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev had 3 more siblings, and he was the youngest. His mother was a homemaker and the most respected member of the family. His father was a doctor and wanted his children to take up the same profession. He also saved his notes from his student life so that his children could use the notes while studying to become a doctor. However, all their children went their separate ways.
<br><br>
 Since childhood, Sadhguru has been very fond of nature. He loved nature so much that he would disappear into the forest for a few days, sit on top of a tree, enjoy the wind, and go into deep meditation. Jaggi Vasudev started practising yoga at the age of 11. He got an education in Yoga from Shri Raghavendra Rao.
<br><br>
 When Sadhguru turned 25, he had given up the pleasures of his life due to some unusual incident. At this age stage, he climbed the Chamundi mountain and sat down on a vast stone. And from there, he started having spiritual experiences. During this, he felt something different, and he felt that he is not only in his body but has spread everywhere in the rocks, the trees, and the earth. After that, he had this experience again and again. This incident completely changed his lifestyle. Because of this, Jaggi Vasudev dedicated his whole life to sharing those experiences. After meditating and travelling for about 1 year, he decided to teach people yoga by sharing his inner experience.
<br><br>
 Two years after experiencing a spiritual awakening, he met his wife Vijaykumari, fondly called Vijji. Their first meeting occurred during a Mysore luncheon, where they had gone as a guest. After this, love letters were exchanged between them for some time. On the auspicious occasion of Mahashivratri in 1984, they tied the knot. Sadhguru’s yoga classes routine was in full swing, and he travelled across South India to organize events. Vizzy used to work in a bank, and she also often accompanied him on his motorbike to support the events.
<br><br>
 In 1990, a lovely daughter, Radhe, was born to Sadhguru and Vijji. Sadhguru explains, “Vizzy wanted to be a mother. She felt that the experience of motherhood was essential in any woman’s life. When I was nineteen years old, I had no idea about ​​getting married or setting up a family. In those days, I went to Rishi Valley School. It was one of those schools which J. Krishnamurti founded.
